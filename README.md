#Prework - MyFirstApp 
Submitted by: Valerie Pena

MyFirstApp is an app that displays a screen with my name, my university, and my aspirational career. It includes a button that, when pressed, changes the background to a randomly generated gradient color. The app demonstrates the basics of UI layout, button interaction, and dynamic styling with Swift.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## Required Features

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Apps + Favorite Features:

1. TikTok: I like TikTok because it’s creative, it allows you to post so much and engage. I love that it has given me confidence to post my ideas.

2. Slack: Slack has been my favorite — I love texting people on this platform and how they make it engaging with notifications on the mobile app. Most times you have to do @channel, which makes you want to check it every morning, and it becomes addictive to answer.

3. VeryFit: I love the way VeryFit formats how many miles you ran, your pace, the time, and it even has images that motivate you to keep going.

4. Instagram: I love Instagram because you can make your page aesthetic, connect with friends, and send funny memes. I also like how people can take it seriously, but there are features that allow you to not take it too seriously — like posting silently so no one sees it right away.

5. Photos App: I like the Photos app because the layout is very convenient. Sometimes when I just want to see my favorites or just my screenshots, I know exactly where to look.

App Idea:

I would love to build an app that helps underrepresented people succeed by connecting them to real opportunities and community support.

The app would have two main sections. One would focus on supporting businesses owned by underrepresented people. It would show a list of local businesses that users could visit, shop at, or leave ratings and reviews for.

The second section would focus on educational support, sharing scholarships, internships, and programs designed to help people from underrepresented backgrounds find and access opportunities more easily.

Additionally, there would be two more sections. One would feature Events and Conferences where users could view upcoming networking events, career fairs, and workshops. The last section would be a Community and Mentorship space for users to connect, find mentors, and share advice or encouragement.

This app would also include resources across all career paths, not just STEM — making it a full-circle support system for anyone from an underrepresented background seeking personal, academic, and career growth.

## Notes
My biggest challenge was that my laptop was running very slowly, which made the building process take longer. I also originally had a creative idea where I wanted to add different images that would pop up each time the background color changed.

However, I ran into a lot of technical problems — the images wouldn’t display correctly, and sometimes they caused my button and other functions to stop working. Because of these issues, I decided to pivot and focus on making the background color change more exciting by using dynamic gradients instead of images.

I think this made the app cleaner and still fun to interact with. Throughout the project, I relied on outside resources like tutorials and advice shared in the Slack support channel. I often looked at other people's questions and answers to better understand how to troubleshoot my issues.

Learning how to connect UI elements, manage animations, troubleshoot Xcode issues, and adjust my approach when something didn’t work was difficult but very rewarding. I learned a lot during the process, and it helped me become more comfortable figuring out problems independently!
